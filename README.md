# Cricket Connect - The Ultimate Cricket Chain Game

**Created by Praneeth**

Cricket Connect is an innovative web-based multiplayer game that challenges players to connect cricket players through their teammates using their knowledge of cricket history. Test your cricket knowledge by finding the shortest path between any two players!

## üéÆ How to Play

### Game Concept
Connect two cricket players through intermediate players who have played with both. For example, to connect **Virat Kohli** and **Shubman Gill** in IPL mode, you might use: `Virat Kohli ‚Üí Yash Dayal ‚Üí Shubman Gill` (because Yash Dayal played with both Virat and Gill in IPL).
