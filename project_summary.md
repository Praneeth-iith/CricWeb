## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Graph Data Structure
```javascript
// Each player is a node with connections to teammates
class CricketGraph {
    constructor(mode) {
        this.players = new Map();           // Player data
        this.adjacencyList = new Map();     // Connection graph
    }
    
    findShortestPath(start, end) {
        // Dijkstra's algorithm implementation
    }
}
```

### Game Architecture
```
Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) → Game Logic → Cricket Database → Graph Algorithm
```

### Key Classes:
- **CricketGraph**: Graph implementation with Dijkstra's algorithm
- **GameRoom**: Room management and game state
- **GameManager**: Overall game coordination
- **CricketConnectApp**: Main application controller
